# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews when the codes are executed. This project requires some background in mazon Sagemaker learned through the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost etc. of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nano Degree Program.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
